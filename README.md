## Booking Flow

1.  **Search & Request**
    
    - Passenger searches buses (sees route, time, type, fare only)
        
    - Sends booking request (no seat count or boarding point yet).
        
2.  **Supervisor Review**
    
    - Supervisor sees request existence (no passenger details, seat count or boarding point)
        
    - Accepts or rejects request
        
3.  **Post-Acceptance**
    
    - Passenger: selects ticket count & boarding point, views full details and ETA (Google Maps API).
        
    - Supervisor: sees passenger details and boarding points.
        
4.  **Ticket Generation**
    
    - Ticket generated with ticket count and boarding point
        
    - Stored in Passenger’s “My Tickets”
        
    - Supervisor sees passenger list with boarding sequence.
